## ðŸŒ¸ SaikiGPT - A Psychic Chatbot for the Ultimate Saiki K. Fan!

My immense love for *The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.* inspired **SaikiGPT**, a chatbot tribute to the most apathetic, sarcastic, and charming psychic in anime. If you, like me, adore his dry wit and internal monologues, this bot is for you!

### ðŸ§  What is this?

**SaikiGPT** is a lightweight Flask web application that brings Saiki Kusuo to life as a conversational AI. It's designed for fun, letting you chat with a persona that embodies all his iconic qualities.

### ðŸ›  Features & Tools

* **Sarcastic Saiki Persona:** Crafted to deliver Saiki's signature dry wit, apathy, and bored psychic mentions â€“ expect plenty of "Yare yare."
* **Powered by OpenRouter.ai:** Utilizes the `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free` model via the OpenRouter API for intelligently (and annoyingly) crafted responses.
* **Simple & Aesthetic Web UI:** A clean, user-friendly chat interface built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, reflecting Saiki's minimalist style.
* **Built with Flask:** Provides a solid, efficient foundation for the chatbot's functionality.
* **Secure Secrets:** Uses `python-dotenv` to securely handle API keys, keeping sensitive information out of the code.
* **API Communication:** The `requests` library manages all interactions with the OpenRouter API for seamless response generation.
