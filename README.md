## 🧠 About the Project

What if your chatbot had *psychic powers*... and also zero patience?  
**SaikiGPT** is a fun AI chatbot themed around **Saiki Kusuo**, the iconic character from *The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.* Whether you're asking about your fate, ranting about school, or just vibing — SaikiGPT responds in true Saiki fashion: psychic, sarcastic, and slightly annoyed.

> 🌸 Just for fun — built with love.  
> 🧩 Made using: Python, Flask, HTML/CSS

## 🧠 Why I Made This

IM A HUUUUGE SAIKI KUSUO FAN!! I rewatch the show like anytime I'm free and I wanted to make this because this was the only way I could motivate myself to do SOMETHING this summer. I mean how could I disappoint Saiki? A fictional character that probably could not care less about me?
